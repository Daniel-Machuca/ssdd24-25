**Instructions:**

For the execution of the project is needed to open a terminal tu run: remotetypes --Ice.Config=config/remotetypes.config

Once this is running, open a second terminal in order to execute the client.py (class implemented to test the functionality) located in: *ssdd-remote-types-main/remotetypes/client.py*

For running the test I've used pytest in the test folder as you proposed. I fixed the problem that led to the failure of one of the test  and added a few more test cases in a different class called *MoreTestStringSet* in the same script.

I've also used pylint in the different python scripts that I filled, in order to fix the possible problems that pylint suggested me to enhance, and incresing the quality of my code.
